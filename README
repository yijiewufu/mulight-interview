This project is for interview only.

HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT:
Clone this resource code from master branch and use eclipse/IDEA to load the project. Then find module : interview-presentaion, then
find the entrence class in package : com.mulight.interview.presentation. Right click and choose run as an Spring Boot App.

How I build this project:
1. Determine to use DDD to design this project;
2. Determine how many domains will be needed to finish this function. And first thought comes up with: product, price(subdomain: discount, checkout), 
   inventory;
3. Determine what action should be taken in each domain to fulfil this function. And that will be :
   product domain : product model can provide product infomation;(but we do not need it now. But I will still keep this domain anyway to 
   make this system reasonable);
   price domain: price model will provide price and discount details(normalPrice, discountUnit, discountUnitPrice, startDate, endDate 
   ect);
   inventory domain: inventory model will provide inventory details, like how many x product left;
   checkout domain: checkout domain will calculate customer's purchasing list.
4. Determine checkout sequence: CheckOutService -> ProductCheckout -> InventoryRepository -> PriceRepository & DiscountRepository
5. Determine which domain's function is most complex and should be spent more time to check and build. And other domain's action should just
   fetch data from DB, redis or other resource;
6. Build a pom project with 4 moudules;
7. Add a health check controller and start up to test if it is working;
8. Build domain and domain's action in module : "interview-domain" and provide DB action's to support domain's action in module: 
   "interview-infrastructure";
9. Aggregate domain's action in one service(WatchCheckOutService) in module : "interview-application";
10. Build post controller with "/checkout" using WatchCheckOutService to return the total amount of the purchasing list;
11. Build auto tests. Will build a set of input lists to call WatchCheckOutService and compare the output with the correct amount.
   (I do suggest we can have test teams to fulfil this part because from different views they can found bugs and help us to build robust 
    applications)
    
Project modules introduction:

Project consists of 4 modules:
interview-presentation : facade layer to interaction with project users. So all the controllers will be here;
interview-application : Aggregate all data(DTOs/VOs) from different domains' application layer's output;
interview-infrastructure : Will handle middlewares like DB, MQ, redis things. The config files should be here and basic operations should
                           be here;
interview-domain : All business logic should be here and cannot invade other layer. We need to abstarct all domain models here which can
                   be used to fulfil business functions. These domain models should not be POJO. It should have lifes.
                   
Domian Driven Design is also the layers invoke sequence should be exactly like this : presentation -> application -> domain -> infrastructure
and we need to stick to it.


Checkout algorithm design：
-------choose right data type ----- 
1. Using List, Set as input, because they do not have an limited size;
2. Use Integer as watch id and it can be primary key in product table with DB bigint;
3. Use BigInteger to build checkout result and product amount since there is no limit of the product unit amount;
   Since watches's price is integer, will use integer here as watch price;(but we do need to check server's memory size because 
   BigInteger is limited by memory's size);
----calculate part ------
4. Iterate the purchasing list , count each watch types' amount and put the result into a hashmap<watchId, watchAmount>;
5. Iterate map's keyset, check if have enough amout left in the inventory -> if yes, fetch price and discount, if no, return error
   telling customers that how many left availabe(here we assume we always have enough left) -> check each watch type if it has 
   discount and calculate each product's total money amount -> sum all watch's type's sum;
6. To iterate input list, use parallelStream because we are facing unlimited amount product, we need to make it faster. So we need to
   use ConcurrentHashMap to make sure everything is fine with parallelStream;
7. To fetch the discount and price we also using parallelStream to query the DB, because we are facing unlimited combination of products;

Test:
Each layer should have unit test and it shoudl start from lower layer to higher layers. infrastructure -> domain -> application -> presentation.
All the methods in the lower layer should be tested and for controller test, use mockmvc to fulfil auto test of api calls.
All the Junit test classes are in presentation layer test folder.

Improve in future:
1. We may need to split each domain apart to reuse in future. If we have resued domains we can produce new applications as fast as we can to satisfy
   every kind of customer needs and saving lots of resource;
2. Involve dubbo/eruka, zookeeper, hystrix, MQ ect middleware things to connect each domain to fulfil complex using;
3. We may need to add BFF layer to provide different api for different OS and gateway to control, limit, count, loadbalence and lead requests;
4. We will need to add new domains basing on the requirements, like user domain to involve security issue and limit user's actions basing on roles or profile ect;
5. We need to change price to bigdecimal, because not all the price are integer;
6. Restful API has limited size of params, so if we use list, we will need front end team to split the list into groups like 100 ids per call then they sum total 
   in front end to display; 
7. Need to add base response, exception, request to make sure the style is the same;
